## Getting started

To get started with the website, first clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Deepakdanger/fishing_app.git
$ cd fishing_app
```
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the development branch
  push:
    branches: [ development ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ development ]

Then install the needed packages (while skipping any Ruby gems needed only in production):

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, setup webpacker configuration

```
$ rails webpacker:install
```

After that, create and migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate
```

To run the project on rails local server:

```
$ rails server
```
## Deploying

youâ€™ll need a Heroku account

To deploy this, youâ€™ll need to create a new Heroku application, switch to the right branch, push up the source, run the migrations, and seed the database with sample users:

```
$ heroku create
$ git checkout feature
$ git push heroku feature:master
$ heroku run rails db:migrate
$ heroku run rails db:seed
```

Visiting the URL returned by the original `heroku create` should now show you the sample website running in production. 

## Branches

Simply check out the corresponding branch using `git checkout`:

```
$ git checkout <branch name>
```
## Testing

For test, In Gemfile include:

```
group :development, :test do
  gem "database_cleaner"
  gem "rspec-rails"
end
```
Then, run `bundle install` and run
```
$ run rails generate rspec:install
```
